                    Although discoveries have been made which date the earliest setllements of Wicklow to 
                    sometime in the Bronze Age (circa 900 BC), Wicklow's recorded history begins in the 5th century, 
                    with the arrival of St. Patrick. The patron saint of Ireland, and one of the most important 
                    figures in the island's history, it's believed he arrived around 432 AD. Landing at Travelahawk 
                    beach in Wicklow Town, he was greeted with hostility from the locals.
                    One of his monks was pelted with stones and lost his teeth, earning him the name Mannt치n, or "Gubby".
                    Patrick and his disciples left Wicklow to continue on their journey to bring Christianity to the island, 
                    but he sent Mannt치n back to convert the Celtic people of Wicklow. It's from this tale that Wicklow 
                    earns its Irish name, <em>Cill Mhant치in</em>, the church of Mannt치n.

                    The era of the vikings (~800 AD) was hugely influential in the history of Wicklow. 
                    Due to the viking's propensity for raiding and plundering coastal setllements,
                    Wicklow was a prime candidate for invasion. The natives of Wicklow at this time were peaceful people, 
                    and had to find ways to protect theselves from the brutal vikings. They constructed round towers, 
                    which were large stone structures, with a door high above the ground. The ruins of these towers still 
                    stand around the county, most notably at St. Kevin's monastery in Glendalough.<br>
                    The name Wicklow is said to originate from the viking era, although there is some dispute over its exact origins.
                    The most common origin story arises from the name <em>"Viking Alo"</em> meaning Viking Meadow, 
                    and through the years this morphed to Wicklow.

                    The Norman era in Wicklow began with the invasion of Ireland in the late 12th century, 
                    led by figures such as Richard de Clare, known as Strongbow. It was around this time 
                    that one of Wicklow's most iconic structures, the "Black Castle" was built. Located on the cliff 
                    towering over Wicklow Harbour, the Black Castle served as a fortress against both external attacks 
                    and local Irish clans. The construction of the Black Castle was a critical step in establishing Norman 
                    power, but it also ignited fierce resistance from the local clans, including the O'Tooles and the O'Byrnes. 
                    Although the locals would occaasionally seize control of the castle, it would always be re-captured by the 
                    crown's forces. The castle stood until 1645, when it caught fire during a raid by the O'Byrne's. 
                    The ruins still exist today, along with the Franciscan Friary, as the last evidence of Norman settlement in Wicklow.

                    As port activity increased in Wicklow, the town and surrounding area continued to expand. 
                    A stone bridge was erected in the late 1600s to give access to the Murrough. Following the 
                    introduction of the Penal Laws, which were a set of rules imposed by the government with the aim of 
                    margnialising Catholics and empowering Protestants, the building of Wicklow Gaol commenced in 1702. 
                    Many offenders of the Penal Laws were held there as were numerous rebels in the aftermath of the 1798 Rebellion.
                    Today, the Wicklow Gaol stands as one of the county's most important buildings and tourist attractions. 
                    It tells the story of what life was like for these prisoners, how rebels including Billy Byrne were treated there, 
                    and the transportation of many to penal colonies such as Botany Bay.<br><br>
                    The 19th century was massively important for Wicklow, with huge growth and development. "Wicklow's most famous son", 
                    the seafarer Robert Halpin was born during this era. As Captain of the then largest ship in the world, <em>SS Great Eastern</em>, 
                    Halpin is most famous for helping connect the world through over 40,000km of transoceanic telegraph cables. 
                    This earned him the nickname "Mr Cable".
